# pytools
Working with professional tools for Python Projects.

This is a repository that I created during a course that teaches how to contribute to open source projects.

    • Git (Repository, SSH Key, Fork, Pull Request, Feature Branch and Gitignore file)
    • Pyenv (used to install Python versions for an OS user and thus avoid damaging the native Python of the OS.)
